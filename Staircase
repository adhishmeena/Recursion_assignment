//Main Code


public class Solution {

    // Returns number of ways to reach s'th stair
 	
     public static int staircase(int n)
		 
    {
        if (n == 1 || n == 0)
            return 1;
        else if (n == 2)
            return 2;
 
        else
            return staircase(n - 3) + staircase(n - 2) + staircase(n - 1);
    }
	/* Your class should be named Solution.
	 * Don't write main() function.
	 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
	 * Return output and don't print it.
	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
